Final Year WebDev Project

**NextJS** - **MongoDB** - **MaterialUI**

This website allows people to share their knowledge of non-fiction, historical, or scientific articles, papers, journals, and essays. The goal would be to bring clarity to even the most confusing and academic documents and foster a large and vibrant discussion on topics once reserved for experts in a field. This would be accomplished with a community-driven system that allows users to gain more standing in the community in the form of points by posting summaries, comments, questions, or answers about a document.

**next.config.js is not included** - this file is needed for the api calls to work
